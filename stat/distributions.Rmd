```

What proportion of the t-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom falls below -2.10?

```{r}
# distribution function.
pt(q = -2.10, df = 18)
```

Above 1.65. The area under the curve is where everything is possible. Its total is 1. You can solve it algebraically.

```{r}
1 - pt(q = 1.65, df = 20)
```

More than 3 units from the mean, above or below.

```{r}
2 * pt(q = -3.0, df = 2)
```

Above -1.79.

```{r}
1 - pt(-1.79, 19)
```

Find the t* cut off that corresponds to a confidence interval of interest. If we're going for a 95% confidence interval, the tails are .025 on each side.

```{r}
qt(0.025, 18)
```
